## 📘 About the Project

**Suica Pool Simulator** is an interactive learning environment designed to demonstrate how the **water volume** and **water level** in a **rectangular pool** change over time when water is flowing in and/or out.

The simulation lets you:

- Resize the pool in 3D (**length, width, height**)
- Control the **inflow** using a faucet
- Control the **outflow** using a drain valve
- Observe real-time changes in:
  - Water volume
  - Water level
  - Fill percentage
  - Inflow and outflow rates

The visualization is powered by the **Suica 3D JavaScript library**, allowing direct interaction with the 3D scene.
